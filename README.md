# bluesound-swagger
The idea behind this repository is to provide a swagger file for the BlueSound API such that several clients can be generated without much effort.

This swagger file could not exists if it wasn't for the great work done by https://github.com/ClausRN/BluesoundAPI and https://github.com/venjum/bluesound!

## But Swagger is for Designing APIs
I know! This is not the optimal way of doing it, but it still gives us a reverse-engineered blueprint of the API so we can generate clients easily.

## Current State
Very VERY pre-alpha.
